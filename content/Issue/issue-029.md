## 项目

- [django-sqlpaginator](https://github.com/bulkan/django-sqlpaginator) (github.com)

This django app allows you to paginate results from queries made with raw sql rather then the ORM. It supports LIMIT and OFFSET as well as ORDER_BY queries. Pretty useful if you need to stray outside the [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) in your django project.

- [numba](https://github.com/numba/numba) (github.com)

This is pretty neat. Numba is a NumPy-aware dynamic Python compiler that uses [LLVM](http://llvm.org/). Numba is intended to “compile Python byte-code to machine code especially for use in the NumPy run-time and SciPy modules.”

- [Python Books](http://pythonbooks.revolunet.com/) (revolunet.com)

Awesome! This good looking site has a list and links to freely available Python books. Lots of gems in here, check out Github for the [source](https://github.com/revolunet/PythonBooks).

- [maze](https://github.com/daleobrien/maze) (github.com)

Cool little project. Who didn’t love mazes when they were a kid. [Dale](https://github.com/daleobrien) certainly did. When working from home this is a fun little thing to keep the kids busy.

- [marisa-trie](https://github.com/kmike/marisa-trie) (github.com)

Static memory-efficient Trie structures for Python (2.x and 3.x). String data in a marisa-trie may take up to 50x-100x less memory than in a standard python dict.

- [pixeltable](https://github.com/discountgenius/pixeltable) (github.com)

Replicate any image file as a HTML table. Check out this [pure html version](http://pycoders.com/python.html) of the official Python logo. Nifty little tool.

- [Selenium tests with Django 1.4+ on Jenkins](http://www.shiningpanda.com/blog/2012/08/23/selenium-tests-django-14-jenkins/) (shiningpanda.com)

- [Finding the top K items in a list efficiently](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/index.php?id=122) (stevehanov.ca)

If you are dealing with large datasets or you like hearing about cool algorithms this post will certainly shed some light on using heaps rather than simply working with lists.

- [Getting started with RedHat's OpenShift](http://www.pythondiary.com/tutorials/getting-started-redhats-openshift.html) (pythondiary.com)

RedHat’s OpenShift is a fairly new kid on the block in the arena of platform as a service providers.  Kevin Veroneau gives a great intro to get Django setup on RedHat’s service.

- [Numba VS Cython](http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/24/numba-vs-cython/) (github.com)

Excellent article! This article is a comparison between pure python, [numba](https://github.com/numba/numba), and cpython for computational analysis. Numba is definitely worth a closer look.


- [An Analysis of the Top Python Repositories Hosted on Github](http://mjp.github.com/2012/08/29/github-python-analysis.html)(github.com)

Very cool article on the state of open source in the python community. We love this article. Definitely solid read tons of insights. Use [pyflakes](https://launchpad.net/pyflakes/) and [pep8](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8/).
