- [在Python中实施单一责任原则(SRP)](https://pycoders.com/link/1197/web)
    + NIKITA SOBOLEV

The Single Responsibility Principle (or SRP) is an important concept in software development. The main idea of this concept is: all pieces of software must have only a single responsibility. Nikita's article guides you through the complex process of writing simple code with some hands-on refactoring examples. You'll use callable classes, SRP, dependency injection, and composition to write simple Python code. Nice read!

    + PYDIST.COM

"The Python ecosystem has been steadily growing [since 2005]. After the first few years of hyper growth as PyPI gained near-full adoption in the Python community, the number of packages actively developed each year—meaning they had at least one release or new distribution uploaded—has increased 28% to 48% every year."

- [Don't Make It Callable](https://pycoders.com/link/1211/web)
    + MOSHE ZADKA

You can make any Python object callable by adding a __call__ method to it. Like operator overloading this seems like a nifty idea at first... but is it really? Moshe's article goes over some use cases and examples to discuss whether making objects callable is a good idea or not.
