Enforcing The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in Python
The Single Responsibility Principle (or SRP) is an important concept in software development. The main idea of this concept is: all pieces of software must have only a single responsibility. Nikita’s article guides you through the complex process of writing simple code with some hands-on refactoring examples. You’ll use callable classes, SRP, dependency injection, and composition to write simple Python code. Nice read!
