The challenge that we and many other firms face is that there’s much higher demand than there is supply: there aren’t enough high-quality Django developers. We’ve talked about this issue intensely internally and with our friends while at DjangoCon and PyCon. We decided that we can offer at least one solution: a new Django-focused code school.

- [The Most Diabolical Python Antipattern](https://realpython.com/blog/python/the-most-diabolical-python-antipattern#.VMesPZO7mKs.reddit)
core python
There are plenty of ways to write bad code. But in Python, one in particular reigns as king. We were exhausted, yet jubilant. After two other engineers had tried for three days each to fix a mysterious Unicode bug before giving up in vain, I finally isolated the cause after a mere day’s work. And ten minutes later, we had a candidate fix.

- [How did we serve more than 20,000 IPython notebooks for Nature readers?](http://developer.rackspace.com/blog/how-did-we-serve-more-than-20000-ipython-notebooks-for-nature)
