- [Optimizing Python in the Real World: NumPy, Numba, and the NUFFT](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/optimizing-python-with-numpy-and-numba/)
    + performance
Too often, tutorials about optimizing Python use trivial or toy examples which may not map well to the real world. In this post I will outline the process of understanding, implementing, and optimizing a non-trivial algorithm i.e. Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT). Along the way, we'll dig into the process of optimizing Python code, and see how a relatively straightforward pure Python implementation, with a little help from Numba, can be made to nearly match the performance of a highly-optimized Fortran implementation of the same algorithm.

- [Finance Event Study in iPython Notebook (Quantopian)](https://www.quantopian.com/posts/research-looking-for-drift-an-event-study-with-share-buybacks-announcements)
    + ipython
Previously, we had released a notebook and algorithm that detailed using Share Buybacks Announcements as a trading signal. In this post, we're going to show you an event study conducted in the same Research Environment that takes an in-depth look at share buybacks announcements as a singular event.

- [Ludovic Gasc (GMLudo): Macro-benchmark with Django, Flask and AsyncIO (aiohttp.web+API-Hour)](http://blog.gmludo.eu/2015/02/macro-benchmark-with-django-flask-and-asyncio.html)
    + django,flask,async-io

Today, I propose you to benchmark a HTTP daemon based on AsyncIO, and compare results with a Flask and Django version. For those who didn't follow AsyncIO news, aiohttp.web is a light Web framework based on aiohttp. It's like Flask but with less internal layers. aiohttp is the implementation of HTTP with AsyncIO.

- [PSF Community Service Award goes to Django Girls](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PythonSoftwareFoundationNews/~3/O86y2zJoWyQ/psf-community-service-award-goes-to.html)
    + PSF
“RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation award the 4th Quarter 2014 Community Service Awards to Ola Sitarska and Ola Sendecka for their work creating and growing Django Girls, an educational program which has reached more than half a dozen countries, and continues to grow to many more.”

- [Intermediate Pythonista: Classes and Objects I](http://intermediatepythonista.com/object-orientation-in-python)
    + core python
In this tutorial, we ignore the basics of classes and object oriented programming and focus on topics that provide a better understanding of object oriented programming in python. It is assumed that we are dealing with new style classes. These are python classes that inherit from object super class.

- [Supporting Both Django 1.7 and South - Trey Hunner](http://treyhunner.com/2014/03/migrating-to-django-1-dot-7/)
    + django
Have an open source Django app with South migrations? Adding support for Django 1.7 might be a little painful. In this post I will discuss the difficulty of supporting Django 1.7 while maintaining South migrations for users of Django 1.6 and below.
