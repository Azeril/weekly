    + python
Pipelining is the decomposition of a larger task into smaller, distinct tasks, so that they may be calculated in parallel. The idea proliferated in computing when CPU technology blossomed, and a fast-but-general model for computing large problems was needed.

- [Implementing Decorators in Python](https://youtu.be/fAiN-iEsGBA)
    + video

This post would be to tell a tutorial on Lua from a Pythonista, comparing Lua features with various Python features and try to create various associations. Make no mistake, I will actually go through basic concepts but somehow comparing the Lua with Python all the time.

- [Use closure for your Django context processors](http://www.peterbe.com/plog/closure-django-context-processors)
    + django
When all the templates in your big complicated website renders, it's quite possible that some pages don't need everything you set up in your context processors. That might mean a heck of a lot of extra computation when it won't ever be displayed.

- [What is the appeal of dynamically-typed languages? (using Python as an example)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/35iamd/what_is_the_appeal_of_dynamicallytyped_languages/)
I genuinely wish I understood the appeal of unityped languages better. Can someone who really knows both well-typed and unityped explain?

- [Optimise Python with closures](https://wrongsideofmemphis.wordpress.com/2015/05/08/optimise-python-with-closures/)
    + core python
This blog post by Dan Crosta is interesting. It talks about how is possible to optimise Python code for operations that get called multiple times avoiding the usage of Object Orientation and using Closures instead.

- [Announcing libbson and libmongoc 1.1.5](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/emptysquare/~3/WrU_HqoQEl0/)
    + mongodb
libbson is a C library for creating, parsing, and manipulating BSON documents. libmongoc is the C Driver for MongoDB, a library for building high-performance applications that communicate with MongoDB in the C language. It also serves as the base for drivers in some higher-level languages.

## New Books

- [Hello Web App](http://hellowebapp.com/)
    + Tracy Osborn
Hello Web App is written for non-programmers by a designer, and will walk you through every step you need before launching your web app live to real customers.
