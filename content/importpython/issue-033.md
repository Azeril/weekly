- [PyCharm 4.5: All Python Tools in One Place](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/whatsnew/?rss)
PyCharm 4.5 unites even more tools and features for productive Python, Django and Web development that work together smoothly to offer you a unique coding experience.

- [PyCon Sweden 2015](http://ilian.io/pycon-sweden-2015/)
    + pycon
In a few words PyCon Sweden 2015 was awesome. Honestly, this was my first Python conference ever but I really hope it won't be the last. Outside the awesome talks and great organisation it was really nice to spend some time with similar minded people and talk about technology, the universe and everything else.

- [Fun with Django's New Postgres Features - Real Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/fun-with-djangos-new-postgres-features/)
    + postgres
This blog post covers how to use the new PostgreSQL-specific ModelFields introduced in Django 1.8 – the ArrayField, HStoreField, and Range Fields.

- [Celery and the Flask Application Factory Pattern](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/celery-and-the-flask-application-factory-pattern)
    + flask
Several readers asked how this integration can be done when using a large Flask application organized around the application factory pattern. It is non-trivial to make Celery, which does not have a dedicated Flask extension, delay access to the application until the factory function is invoked.

- [Interested in organizing DjangoCon Europe 2016?](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/may/18/interested-organizing-djangocon-europe-2016/)
    + django
DjangoCon Europe 2015 is just a few short weeks away - but we need to start planning for next year! Each DjangoCon Europe event is run by a different volunteer organizing committee.

- [Survival Analysis with IPython: R vs. Python](https://plot.ly/ipython-notebooks/survival-analysis-r-vs-python/)
    + ipython
In this notebook we introduce Survival Analysis using both R and Python. We will compare programming languages and leverage Plotly's Python and R APIs to convert graphics to interactive Plotly objects.

- [Podcast conversation about teaching python with Grok Learning](http://www.talkpythontome.com/episodes/show/8/teaching-python-at-grok-learning-and-classrooms)
    + podcast
Australia is making text-based computer programming a core requirement for high school students? Grok Learning is building the platform to make teaching it to kids a joy for teachers and students. Our guest, Dr. James Curran is a key player in both of these projects.

- [Opbeat talks to Lincoln Loop](https://twitter.com/opbeat/status/598174804349308928/photo/1)
    + performance
Founder of Lincoln Loop, Peter Baumgartner (@ipmb), talks about their stack and shares his 3 top tips for optimising Django applications. Filmed at Pycon in Montreal.

- [Comparing the weather of places I've lived in using pandas/notebook](https://blog.wearewizards.io/comparing-the-weather-of-places-ive-lived-in)
    + ipython
I have lived in 4 countries on 3 continents (so far). When people ask me about these places, the first thing that comes to my mind is the weather. Having lived in these places I knew roughly how they compared but was curious about the exact numbers. What better way than to visualize data than a ipython notebook!

- [On parsing C, type declarations and fake headers](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/on-parsing-c-type-declarations-and-fake-headers/)
    + core python
pycparser has become fairly popular in the past couple of years (especially following its usage in cffi). This means I get more questions by email, which leads me to getting tired of answering the same questions. So this blog post is a one-stop shop for the (by far) most frequently asked question about pycparser - how to handle headers that your code #includes.

- [Run OS command with timeout on a list of files using several threads (Python)](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/579056-run-os-command-with-timeout-on-a-list-of-files-usi/)
    + core python
This hack runs a command sequentially on a list of files using two simultaneous threads. If one of the commands takes more than a set time, it's killed and the program goes for the next file. EDITED to add some exception handling.

- [Python coroutines with async and await](http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/643786/9c0bd83dff0df3b8/)
    + core python
It is already possible to create coroutines for asynchronous processing in Python. But a recent proposal would elevate coroutines to a full-fledged language construct, rather than treat them as a type of generator as they are currently. Two new keywords, async and await, would be added to the language to support coroutines as first-class Python features.

- [PyDev of the Week: Vasudev Ram](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheMouseVsThePython/~3/KRxZ8XxqVgM/)
    + interview
This week we welcome Vasudev Ram (@vasudevram) as our PyDev of the Week. Vasudev is a freelance developer who blogs on lots of different software topics, including Python. He is the creator of xtopdf.
