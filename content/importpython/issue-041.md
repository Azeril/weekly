- [How to Run Django with mod_wsgi and Apache with a virtualenv Python environment on a Debian VPS | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-run-django-with-mod_wsgi-and-apache-with-a-virtualenv-python-environment-on-a-debian-vps)
    + apache
Looks like a good guide to running Django on apache.

- [Clayton Parker - So you think you can PDB? - PyCon 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0pIW5tJrRM)
    + pdb
This talk will be an introduction to the most commonly used Python Debugger commands and what they do. Learn how to navigate and inspect code from the pdb prompt so you can better understand how it works. The Python Debugger is a valuable debugging tool for all levels of Python programmers. You should walk away being able to debug the next Python code you encounter!

- [Detect algorithmically generated domain names with Python Pandas, matplotlib and sci-kit learn](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ClickSecurity/data_hacking/blob/master/dga_detection/DGA_Domain_Detection.ipynb)
    + ipython
In this notebook we're going to use some great python modules to explore, understand and classify domains as being 'legit' or having a high probability of being generated by a DGA (Dynamic Generation Algorithm). We have 'legit' in quotes as we're using the domains in Alexa as the 'legit' set. The primary motivation is to explore the nexus of IPython, Pandas and scikit-learn with DGA classification as a vehicle for that exploration.

- [Building the SQLite FTS5 Search Extension](http://charlesleifer.com/blog/building-the-sqlite-fts5-search-extension/)
    - sqlite
SQLite 3.8.11.1 contains a new, experimental version of the full-text search extension named FTS5. Reviewing the documentation for FTS5, I saw that it includes a couple cool enhancements, namely a more sophisticated query language, and built-in BM25 result ranking. I decided to give it a try and thought I'd share my notes on compiling the extension in case anyone else is curious.

- [Retrying celery failed tasks](http://agiliq.com/blog/2015/08/retrying-celery-failed-tasks/)
    - celery
In one of my projects, I work with Twitter api. I need to fetch a user's tweets. Twitter provides an api endpoint for fetching user's tweets. Fetching of tweets involve network calls and so should happen in background, so we fetch the tweets using a celery task. So I have a celery task which makes one api call to Twitter. If I am able to fetch the tweets I consider the celery task was successful.

- [Why Was Python Written with the GIL ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3fqpys/why_was_python_written_with_the_gil/)
    - gil
The global interpreter lock (GIL) seems to be often cited as a major reason why threading and the like is a touch tricky in Python - which raises the question "Why was that done in the first place?" Being Not A Programmer, I've got no clue why that might be - what was the logic behind putting in the GIL?

We’re incredibly excited to announce the launch of Django Girls RDU, a group in NC’s Triangle region that hosts free one-day Django coding workshops for women. Django Girls is part of an international movement that’s helped 1,600 (and counting!) women learn how to code.

- [Pandas and Cubs](http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/08/pandas-and-cubs/)
    - data science
A few days ago, while looking at the major league standings, I felt certain the Cubs have been at a standstill since May. For the Cubs, this is an improvement—they spend most seasons in decline—but it’s less than what was expected of them according to several preseason predictions. I decided to use Pandas and Matplotlib to see how (and if) their season was progressing.

We are looking for candidates who would love to collaborate with us in our offices in downtown Durham, NC to directly contribute to both open source projects created at Caktus as well as open source projects used by Caktus, such as Django. As previously mentioned, this will be a part-time position and will be taking the place of our normal fall internship program. If successful, we may expand this into a full-time position for future iterations.
