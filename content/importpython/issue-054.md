- [Advanced Python Book](https://migrateup.com/store/advanced-python-book/)
Aaron Maxwell has been running the The Advanced Python Newsletter for a while and written some really good Python post that we have shared over the year. He has jus released his book , Advanced Python. A Not-For-Beginners Guide To Mastering The Most Powerful Patterns, Features And Development Strategies Modern Python Provides. Have a look. 

- [Building a Rest API with the Bottle Framework](http://www.toptal.com/bottle/building-a-rest-api-with-bottle-framework)
Bottle is a minimalist Python web framework. It is lightweight, fast, and easy to use, and is well-suited to building RESTful services. In my own tests on the virtual servers available from DigitalOcean, I found that the combination of the uWSGI server stack and Bottle could achieve as low as a 140?s overhead per request. In this article, I’ll provide a walkthrough of how to build a RESTful API service using Bottle. 

- [Testing Django Applications](http://blog.endpoint.com/2015/12/testing-django-applications.html)
The purpose of this blog post is to capture my Django and testing study points, summarize useful resource links as well as to itemize some guidelines for implementing tests for newcomers to the project. It also provides a comparison between Python's standard unittest library and the aforementioned pytest. Its focus is on Django database interaction.

- [Using Docker in PyCharm](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Pycharm/~3/1kuKe77FdjI/)
    + docker
Modern development workflows emphasize isolation and reproducability in development and production. Docker and its platform approach to containers has become very popular. With PyCharm Professional Edition 5, Docker is now supported as a remote interpreter. Let’s take a look at PyCharm’s Docker integration in action.

We aim to raise $200,000 in order to fully fund our Fellow program, continue contributing to Django Girls workshops, sponsor official Django conferences, and more. 

- [Python Is Not C: Take Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3x32d0/python_is_not_c_take_two/)
The lesson is clear: do not write Python code as you would do in C. Use numpy array operations rather than iterate on arrays. For me it meant a mental shift. Given Python ecosystem is rapidly evolving, I decided to revisit this conclusion using the performance improvement tools that I discuss in my previous post. Let me briefly introduce the topic again for those who haven't read Python Is Not C. I had to deal with geospatial data as part of a project aiming to help a cyclist athlete for the Race Across America (RAAM) 2015 competition I was given a gps track with about 25,000 points, and I repeatedly needed to find the closest point on that track given a latitude and a longitude. Let me focus on this problem from now on. I will be using two datasets for my experiments: 

- [Automation and pty(4)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3wyo2a/automation_and_pty4/)
Any command-line UNIX interface may be automated. This article will demonstrate the use of pseudo-terminals, which cause programs to believe they are attached to a terminal, even when they are not!. At first, fooling programs into beleiving they are attached to a terminal may not seem useful, but it is used in a wide variety of software solutions. This programming technique is indespensible in automation and testing fields. 

- [Time Zones in Pytz & Django](http://tommikaikkonen.github.io/timezones)
Time zones, those stupid things getting in the way of shipping software! If you read the Django documentation on time zones and still feel lost, this article is for you. I'll assume you are familiar with the datetime library and know the difference between naïve and aware datetimes. I'll also assume you know some Django. 

- [The easiest way to build and manage your Django projects - Aldryn](http://www.aldryn.com/en/)
It's a commercial product that allows you to create a CMS quickly. It's based on Django. Worth a look. 

- [Episode 35 - Sylvain Thénault on ASTroid](http://podcastinit.podbean.com/e/episode-35-sylvain-thenault-on-astroid/)
    + podcast
The Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) is a powerful abstraction that allows for a number of innovative projects. ASTroid is a library that provides additional convenience methods to simplify working with the AST. In this episode we spoke with Sylvain Thénault from Logilab about his work on ASTroid and how it is used to power the popular PyLint static analysis tool.
