- [Running IPython as a Docker container under OpenShift.](http://blog.dscpl.com.au/2015/12/running-ipython-as-docker-container.html)

I hope this will be useful in guiding people to build better Docker images which are more portable to different ways that Docker can be used. This is going to be much more important going forward as Docker starts to be incorporated into more high level platforms for hosting containers.

- [Introducing Lektor — A Static File Content Management System For Python](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/12/21/introducing-lektor)
A content management system that uses flat files as source files like most other systems, but it has a locally hosted admin panel that a non programmer can use. You install the application, double click on the project, a browser opens and you can edit the pages. It builds in the background into static HTML files and there is a publish button to ship it up to a server. For collaboration one can use Dropbox.

- [Let’s Build A Simple Interpreter. Part 1 to Part 7. [Python and Rust]](http://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part7/)
If you don’t know how compilers work, then you don’t know how computers work. If you’re not 100% sure whether you know how compilers work, then you don’t know how they work.” — Steve Yegge So, do you know how compilers and interpreters work? And I mean, are you 100% sure that you know how they work? If you don’t. Do not worry. If you stick around and work through the series and build an interpreter and a compiler with me you will know how they work in the end. And you will become a confident happy camper too.


- [Sophy: fast Python bindings for Sophia Database](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3xilqu/sophy_fast_python_bindings_for_sophia_database/)

Sophia is a powerful key/value database with loads of features packed into a simple C API. In order to use this database in some upcoming projects I've got planned, I decided to write some Python bindings and the result is sophy. In this post, I'll describe the features of Sophia database, and then show example code using sophy, the Python wrapper.
