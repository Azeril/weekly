- [Development and Deployment of Cookiecutter-Django via Docker - Real Python](https://realpython.com/blog/python/development-and-deployment-of-cookiecutter-django-via-docker/)
    + django
Let’s look at how to bootstrap a Django Project pre-loaded with the basic requirements needed in order to quickly get a project up and running. Further, beyond the project structure, most bootstrapped projects also take care of setting up the development and production environment settings, without troubling the user much – so we’ll look at that as well.

- [Book Review: Web Scraping with Python](http://toddhayton.com/2016/01/04/book-review-web-scraping-with-python/)
    + python
The book is terrific and manages to cover a lot of important scraping topics in just 140 pages. The author provides enough information so that by the end of the book you've got an arsenal of techniques and code for scraping a variety of websites. At the same time, the book avoids getting bogged down on any one topic.

- [Beautiful, fully-customizable choropleth maps in Python + matplotlib + basemap (with ipython notebook in github repo)](http://geoffboeing.com/2015/12/world-population-projections/)
    + python
The U.N. world population prospects data set depicts the U.N.’s projections for every country’s population, decade by decade through 2100. The 2015 revision was recently released, and I analyzed, visualized, and mapped the data (methodology and code described below).

- [Integrating Facebook Login in AngularJS App with Satellizer](http://www.toptal.com/angular-js/facebook-login-angularjs-app-satellizer)
Satellizer, an easy to use token-based authentication module for AngularJS, simplifies the process of implementing authentication mechanism in AngularJS, The library comes with built-in support for Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, GitHub, Bitbucket, Yahoo, Twitch, and Microsoft (Windows Live) accounts.

- [Serializing Authenticated User Data With Django REST Framework](http://gregblogs.com/tlt-serializing-authenticated-user-data-with-django-rest-framework/)
    + django
I have a user-agnostic set of data: data that has nothing to do with the user viewing the site. I want to make that data somewhat personal by adding attributes (fields) to the data that suit an authenticated (logged-in) user. Django REST framework easily allows me to serialize the data model. The serialized data has fields corresponding with data model fields.

- [Your Django Story: Meet K. Rain Leander](http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/136629466373)
    + interview
K. Rain Leander is a systematic, slightly psychic, interdisciplinary developer evangelist with a Bachelor’s in dance and a Master’s in IT. An epic public speaker, she has disappeared within a box stuffed with swords, created life, and went skydiving with the Queen. Seriously. Rain is an active technical contributor with RDO manager, OpenStack, Django Girls, and Project DO.

- [Disabling Migrations While Testing](http://albertoconnor.ca/blog/2016/Jan/6/disabling-migrations-while-testing)
    + django
If you have a large Django 1.7+ project with a lot of migrations running test even with --keepdb can be slow just because the new migration framework has to order the migrations even if there is nothing to do.

- [Python Module of the Week for Python 3](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/PyMOTW/~3/ATlwJ72Lxmo/)
    + python
Over the last several years since my book, The Python Standard Library by Example, was published many folks I’ve talked with at conferences or by email have asked when I would be updating the content for Python 3. I’ve been putting off that work, mostly because of other projects. I’m happy to announce that I’ve finally started updating the content and intend to publish updates weekly.

- [Elements of Python Style](https://github.com/amontalenti/elements-of-python-style)
    + python
This document goes beyond PEP8 to cover the core of what I think of as great Python style. It is opinionated, but not too opinionated. It goes beyond mere issues of syntax and module layout, and into areas of paradigm, organization, and architecture. I hope it can be a kind of condensed "Strunk & White" for Python code.

- [Pymux: a tmux clone in pure Python](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3z9rwt/pymux_a_tmux_clone_in_pure_python/)
A terminal multiplexer (like tmux) in Python
