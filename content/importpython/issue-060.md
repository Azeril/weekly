- [Project Jupyter and IPython Podcast Interview](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/44/project-jupyter-and-ipython)
    + podcast
One of the fastest growing areas in Python is scientific computing. In scientific computing with Python, there are a few key packages that make it special. These include NumPy / SciPy / and related packages. The one that brings it all together, visually, is IPython (now known as Project Jupyter). That's the topic on episode 44 of Talk Python To Me.

- [Testing Django Views](http://kracekumar.com/post/138492827565)
    + testing
Rise of mobile and Single Page Application shifted majority of web development towards API centric development. Testing API is super simple with data in and data out, but testing a django view in classic web application is difficult since HTML is returned. REST semantics and status code helped to distinguish response without inspecting body.

- [Understanding JSON Web Tokens with Example in Python](http://blog.apcelent.com/json-web-token-tutorial-example-python.html)
In this article we are going to learn about securing our REST API with JSON Web Tokens. JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties. JWT happens to be backed by companies like Firebase, Google, Microsoft, and Zendesk.

- [High scalability - Async Python and Cassandra with Gevent](http://rustyrazorblade.com/2016/02/async-python-and-cassandra-with-gevent/)
    + concurrency
Python's threading, GIL, and lack of async code in Python 2.7 can be very frustrating. Fortunately, there's been some great projects over the years that have either patched async calls into Python or been a totally separate distribution entirely. For instance, two alternative distributions, IronPython and Jython, don't have the GIL and it's associated problems. There's also Stackless Python, which manages microthreads at the interpreter level, avoiding heavy weight OS threads, in addition to other features.

- [django-ses/django-ses: A Django email backend for Amazon's Simple Email Service](https://github.com/django-ses/django-ses)
    + aws
Django-SES is a drop-in mail backend for Django. Instead of sending emails through a traditional SMTP mail server, Django-SES routes email through Amazon Web Services' excellent Simple Email Service (SES).

- [YPlan/django-ratelimit: Cache-based rate-limiting for Django](https://github.com/YPlan/django-ratelimit)
    + django
Django Ratelimit provides a decorator to rate-limit views. Limiting can be based on IP address or a field in the request--either a GET or POST variable.

- [Smartyparse: dynamic object-oriented binary packing and unpacking](https://github.com/Muterra/py_smartyparse)
SmartyParse is a binary packing/unpacking (aka building/parsing) library for arbitrary formats written for python >= 3.3. If you have a defined binary format (.tar, .bmp, byte-oriented network packets, etc) or are developing one, SmartyParse is a way to convert those formats to and from Python objects. Its most direct alternative is Construct, which is admittedly much more mature.
